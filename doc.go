// This package aims to give new ideas to developers, beginner/intermediate in Go, about some language specific features that could be useful in some design patterns. The unit tests in `all_test.go` should be enough to understand "what makes it good" and show it works (and how).
//
// In general : open a subpackage, read the code and comments, and check `all_test.go` to see if unit tests are showing usage examples.
// Please try and reimplement those yourself to understand and get used to it. It's always a simple trick that can improve code *a lot*.
